## Key Features
### Forum Page
The heart of Reel Northeast, the Forum page, provides a thriving community for fishing enthusiasts to engage in discussions and share their valuable fishing experiences. The user-friendly interface offers convenient search, category filtering, and sorting options based on the newest, oldest, most views, and most comments. Registered users can actively contribute to the dynamic community by creating new threads, and fostering interactive and lively discussions among anglers.
### Recursive Commenting System
One of the standout features of the forum application backend is its implementation of a recursive commenting system, allowing users to engage in multi-level discussions through comments and replies. This recursive structure enables users to respond to existing comments, fostering in-depth and interactive conversations within each thread.
### State Page
The State page enhances the forum application's potential by dynamically fetching and displaying the most recent threads related to the selected state. With an intuitive interface showcasing essential thread details, such as title, author, date, comments, and views, users are encouraged to actively participate in discussions. Seamlessly navigating to detailed thread views further enriches the user experience, making the State page an invaluable asset to drive user engagement and satisfaction.
### Species Page
On the other hand, the Species page takes users on an immersive journey through the captivating world of fish species. The species cards feature a stunning flip animation, with an enticing image of the fish on the front and detailed descriptions on the back. Users can conveniently filter between saltwater and freshwater species, adding focus and convenience to their discovery. This interactive and visually appealing exploration makes the Species page a standout feature for the application's aquatic-themed content.
### Profile Page
